🔧 5. Free Tiers & Cost Considerations

AWS has a 1-year free tier on eligible EC2 instances, which is great for practice.

Azure also offers a free trial and credits (typically around 30 days with some credits) you can use to experiment with VMs without being billed immediately.

This lets learners safely create, test, and delete machines while they learn.

🤖 6. Manual vs. Automated Creation

The video emphasizes that while manual GUI creation is useful to understand the basics, in DevOps you’ll often want to automate this process — because manually clicking through portals is slow, error-prone, and hard to repeat.

Tools mentioned for automation include:

AWS CLI / API

Terraform (can work across AWS, Azure, and other clouds)

CloudFormation (for AWS)

AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)

Automation helps turn infrastructure setup into repeatable code — a key DevOps practice.
