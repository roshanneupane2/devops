What Cloudflare Does (Main Features)
1️⃣ CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Cloudflare has hundreds of data centers worldwide (called PoPs / Edge nodes).

It stores cached copies of your site so users get content from the nearest location — meaning:

✔ faster loading
✔ less latency
✔ reduced server load

Example:

Your server is in USA

User is in Japan
→ Cloudflare serves from Tokyo edge node

2️⃣ Security (Very important for DevOps)

Cloudflare protects from:

🛡 DDoS attacks
🛡 Bots
🛡 SQL injection
🛡 XSS
🛡 Layer 7 attacks

It provides:

✔ WAF (Web Application Firewall)
✔ Rate limiting
✔ IP blocking
✔ Bot management

This means malicious traffic is stopped before hitting your server.

3️⃣ DNS (super fast + reliable)

Cloudflare DNS is one of the fastest in the world.

It resolves domains like:

example.com → 192.168.x.x

Fast DNS = faster browsing

4️⃣ SSL / HTTPS (Free Certificates)

You can enable HTTPS easily.

Cloudflare:
✔ issues SSL
✔ manages TLS
✔ encrypts traffic

So even small sites get security.
